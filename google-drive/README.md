## AeroGear.js OAuth2 Test - Access Google Drive

This purpose of this repo is to show how to use the OAuth2 adapter in AeroGear.js and how it integrates into Pipeline

Basically, it will ask for your permission for this app to access your google drive account and then list the files you have

after cloning the repo, run:

    $ npm install && bower install

Then

    $ grunt server

The web app will then be available at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

Be sure to also have a Google Account since we are going to access Google Drive

_Warning: There will be bugs  :)_
